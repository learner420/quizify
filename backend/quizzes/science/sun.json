    "question": "What is the primary element in the Sun's composition?",
    "options": [
      "Hydrogen",
      "Helium",
      "Oxygen",
      "Carbon"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "Hydrogen",
    "explanation": "The Sun is primarily composed of hydrogen, which accounts for about 75% of its mass and fuels nuclear fusion in its core."

    "question": "What process generates energy in the Sun?",
    "options": [
      "Nuclear fusion",
      "Nuclear fission",
      "Combustion",
      "Radioactive decay"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "Nuclear fusion",
    "explanation": "The Sun produces energy through nuclear fusion, where hydrogen atoms combine under high pressure and temperature to form helium."

    "question": "Approximately what is the temperature at the Sun's core?",
    "options": [
      "1 million \u00b0C",
      "5 million \u00b0C",
      "15 million \u00b0C",
      "100 million \u00b0C"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "15 million \u00b0C",
    "explanation": "The Sun's core reaches temperatures around 15 million \u00b0C, enabling the extreme conditions required for nuclear fusion."

    "question": "What causes solar wind?",
    "options": [
      "Eruptions from sunspots",
      "Disturbances in the Sun's magnetic field",
      "Charged particles escaping the Sun's gravity",
      "Radiation from solar flares"
    ],
    "correct_answer": "Charged particles escaping the Sun's gravity",
    "explanation": "Solar wind consists of charged particles (mostly electrons and protons) that stream outward from the Sun's corona due to high thermal energy overcoming gravity."
