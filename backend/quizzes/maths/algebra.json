    "correct_answer": "5 and -1",
    "explanation": "The characteristic equation is det([[3-\u03bb, 4], [2, 1-\u03bb]]) = (3-\u03bb)(1-\u03bb) - 8 = \u03bb\u00b2 - 4\u03bb - 5 = 0. Solving gives eigenvalues \u03bb = 5 and \u03bb = -1."

    "explanation": "Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate (1 + 2i): (3+4i)(1+2i) = -5 + 10i. Divide by 1\u00b2 + (2)\u00b2 = 5. Result is -1 + 2i. Modulus: \u221a((-1)\u00b2 + 2\u00b2) = \u221a5."
