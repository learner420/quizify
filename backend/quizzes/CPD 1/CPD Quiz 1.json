            "When the cost of equity (ke) is less than the internal rate of return (r)",

        ],
        "correct_answer": "When the cost of equity (ke) is greater than the internal rate of return (r)",
        "explanation": "Walter's model suggests a 100% payout when ke > r.  This is because if the shareholders' required return (ke) is *higher* than the firm's return on investment (r), the shareholders are better off receiving the earnings as dividends and investing them elsewhere at their higher required rate. The firm cannot generate returns as high as shareholders can on their own."

        "question": "If a firm's cost of equity (ke) is greater than its internal rate of return (r), what does Walter's Model recommend regarding dividend payout?",

        ],
        "correct_answer": "100% payout",
        "explanation": "When ke > r, the company is not earning as much on its investments as shareholders require.  Walter's model indicates that, in this situation, it's best to distribute *all* earnings as dividends, allowing shareholders to reinvest the funds at their higher required rate of return."

        "explanation": "Walter's model DOES suggest an optimal dividend policy *based on the relationship between ke and r*, but it doesn't imply a firm can *always* increase share value simply by changing dividends.  The optimal policy depends on whether ke > r, ke < r, or ke = r.  The value is maximized by choosing the *correct* payout, not just any arbitrary change."

        "explanation": "The 'bird-in-hand' argument, attributed to Myron Gordon, posits that investors prefer the certainty of current dividends over the potential for future capital gains, which are considered riskier.  This is because a dividend received today is certain (a bird in the hand), while future capital gains are uncertain (worth two in the bush)."

        "correct_answer": "A passive decision",
        "explanation": "The Residuals Theory states that dividends are a *passive* result of the firm's investment decisions.  The firm should first identify and invest in all profitable projects.  Only the 'residual' earnings, those left over *after* all investment opportunities are exhausted, should be paid out as dividends.  The dividend decision is thus secondary and passive."

        "explanation": "MM's dividend irrelevance proposition hinges on the idea of *arbitrage*.  In a perfect capital market (MM's assumption), if two identical companies have different dividend policies, investors can create 'homemade dividends' through buying or selling shares to offset any differences. This arbitrage process ensures that dividend policy doesn't affect firm value."

        "explanation": "Statements a and b are incorrect. The MM model, under its assumptions, argues that dividend policy is *irrelevant*.  Paying a dividend causes the share price to drop by approximately the amount of the dividend, leaving the investor's total wealth (dividend + share value) unchanged. Statement 'c' is a correct representation of the MM model, options a + b are not."

        "correct_answer": "Dividend and Capital Issue (New Equity)",
        "explanation": "MM's arbitrage argument works because investors can replicate the effect of a dividend (or lack thereof) by selling shares (to create a 'homemade dividend') or buying shares (if dividends are not paid and they want a cash flow).  This process involves the issuance or repurchase of equity (capital issue)."

        "explanation": "When ke = r, the firm's investments earn exactly the return shareholders require.  Therefore, it doesn't matter whether earnings are retained or paid out; the value of the firm will be the same regardless of the dividend payout ratio.  The DP ratio is irrelevant in this specific scenario."

        "correct_answer": "The value of the firm depends on its earning power (and investment policy)",
        "explanation": "The core of MM's argument is that the firm's value is determined by its *investment decisions* and the resulting earning power, *not* by how those earnings are divided between dividends and retained earnings. In a perfect market, dividend policy is simply a financing decision, not a value-creating one."

        "explanation": "While technically if investors are not ready to pay this would also cause this, the root cause is the belief. If the payout is zero, and the market price is also zero, it implies investors place no value on the firm's retained earnings. This is a *critical* aspect of Gordon's model: if dividends are zero *and* the firm's investments don't generate sufficient returns (or investors *believe* they won't), the stock has no value."

This is because the reinvestment rate of retained earnings is equal to the shareholders' required rate of return, making the dividend policy irrelevant to the firm's value in this specific case."
